my solutions to OBI problems

OBI stands for *Olimpíada Brasileira de Informática*, which means Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics. It's the national level informatics olympiad in Brazil. 
Solutions to ongoing tests (due to the covid-19 pandemic the exams are being held online) are commited to a separate, private repo, and only merged after the test is over.
